# nbody

This is code that performs N-body:Many-body calculations with various quantum chemistry software packages driven by Gaussian09 through the `External` script feature. 

Here are some papers that used this code:

- [Benchmark Structures and Harmonic Vibrational Frequencies Near the CCSD(T) Complete Basis Set Limit for Small Water Clusters: (H2O)n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]( https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00225)
- [Assessing the accuracy of some popular DFT methods for computing harmonic vibrational frequencies of water clusters](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4936654)
- [N-body:Many-body QM:QM vibrational frequencies: Application to small hydrogen-bonded clusters](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4829463)

The approach is based on research under [Greg Tschumper](http://quantum.chem.olemiss.edu/index.html) at the University of Mississippi.
